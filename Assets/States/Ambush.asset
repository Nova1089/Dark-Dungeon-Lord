  storyText: 'Ambush


    As you and the king negotiate further. Your team faces
    an ambush. You are seized while you watch your army get scorched in flaming oil.
    Archers and ballistas rain down fire. And courageous knights ride to pick off
    the stragglers.

    

    The king takes you to his dungeon.

    

    1.
    Try again!

    2. Go pout for a while.
