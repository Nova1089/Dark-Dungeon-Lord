  storyText: 'Corridor


    Your bolt whistles straight into the neck of a soldier.
    They look around confused. They can hear your huge sword scraping across the
    concrete, drawing closer. They courageously charge. You cut one cleanly in half
    and they scatter, but not before you grab one by the throat.



    1. You snap
    his arm cleanly. He will send a message to his master that the dark lord is coming.

    2.
    You crush him with your bear hands, then you drag him to skull mountain. He will
    join your collection of skulls.'
