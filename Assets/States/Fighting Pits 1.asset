  storyText: "Fighting Pits 1\r\n\nA prisoner holds his wound and gasps after cutting
    down his opponent. Your minions cheer savagely. He trembles as his next opponent
    is already getting shoved into the pit. He gets knocked to the ground and rolls
    just in time to avoid a devastating blow. \r\n\r\nHe lets out a shriek, makes
    a deep cut to his opponents leg and stands up. \n\n1. How amusing! Return them
    both to their cells.\r\n2. Let your minions decide the loser's fate."
