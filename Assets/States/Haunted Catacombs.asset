    into the haunted catacombs. Your minions come face to face with horror. Women,
    children, fiends and ghouls, a sorcerer, demonic artifacts, barbaric equipment,
    and the smell of rot and decay. Even your minions begin to feel terrified.\r\n\r\n1.
    You kick a scared minion into the fray. The monsters, ghouls and even the women
    tear him apart. \rHue hue hue. You beckon your minions even further.\r\n\r\n2.

    a little fun? You and your minions bring havock on the vile creatures.\r\n\r\n"
