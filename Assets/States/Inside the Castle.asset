  storyText: "Inside the Castle\r\n\nYou will it and you bring you and your army
    straight into the king's castle. \r\n\r\nBlood begins to runneth over the land.
    Men struggle and fight to their last breath. Neither side will yield. Heroes
    are being made and husbands are being lost. The skies go dark and begin to crackle
    and roar. It's as if heaven and hell are watching.\r\n\r\n1. You infiltrate the
    king's quarters at the most opportune moment.\r\n2. You take the moment to relish
    in the feeling of power and evil that overtakes the battlegrounds."
