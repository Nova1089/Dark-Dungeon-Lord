  storyText: 'King''s Quarters


    You swing your huge hunk of metal at the king.
    Over and over you strike downward. The king is in awe of your speed and power,
    but he holds tenaciously. He slips to the side and swings back, only to graze
    and scar your face. Your sword breaks through his sword and then through his
    armor. You look upon your kingdom and ponder what wicked things may come next.
