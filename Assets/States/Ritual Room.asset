  storyText: 'Ritual Room


    You''ve tied a couple slaves to an alter. Your minions
    surround in perfect formation. You perform an incantation as you cook your huge
    sword in hot embers. With one almighty sweep of your sword, you open a crack
    in space-time and a demon emerges. Your minions begin disintegrating in his presence.

    

    1.
    Swing your huge sword into his skull.

    2. Enter through the crack in space-time.'
